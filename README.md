# Backbone-BootstrapSelector
A Backbone wrapper around a Select element that is styled using Bootstrap classes

###Notes: This selector needs some work, it was written as a view in an app, and my plan is to convert it to a plugin, so there are a number of TODOs here.

###TODO Items:
- convert to a plugin
- add documentation to src
- overview
- instructions with samples
- minified code
- jasmine tests
